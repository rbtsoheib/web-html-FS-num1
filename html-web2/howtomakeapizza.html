    <p>so.....you are asking me how i imagine making my pizza ? okey, follow my steps
    </p>
    <h1>first of all: we need the ingredients</h1>
    <h4>if you ask me which one i would choose, it would definitely take the pepperoni one</h4>
    <h2>-tomatoes</h2>
    <h2>-mozzarella</h2>
    <h2>-feta</h2>
    <h2>-olives, sauce, peper,salt, garlic, oil, flower. </h2>
    <p>if you didnt want to make the pizza number one you can copy

    <h1>second of all:we need to make the dough</h1>
    <h4>you need to give all your efforts for the dough to be good!</h4>
    <h3>-the dough is the first and most important part:</h3>
    <p>to make the dough we need to mix the flower and oil adding to that
        the salt to give it that good taste and of course we can use some baking powder to give it
        that thikness
    </p>
    <h1>third of all: we need to make the sauce</h1>
    <h4>this is a easy step, even my nephew can do it</h4>
    <h3>-to make it taste like a pizza we need the sauce:</h3>
    <p>to make the sauce, grab your tomatoes and scratch them and mix with some greenies</p>
    <p>put them in pan and turn on the heat and let it melt till done</p>
    <h2>OR</h2>

    <h1>fourth of all: we need to top our pizza in our way</h1>
    <h4>i will make the pepperoni one :)</h4>
    <h3>-since it is my pizza that we are working on, lets put my favourites:</h3>
    <p>pepperoni,cheese,mushrooms,olives,onions and of course our tomato sauce</p>
    <h1>FINALLY: we put our pizza in the oven on 200degrees for 30min</h1>
    <p>and in the end it doesnt matter how it looks like, the efforts are more important</p>
    <p>but it should look like these two images</p>
